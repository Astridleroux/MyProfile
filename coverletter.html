		Dear Sir or Madam,
		<br>
		<br>
		I am currently a master student at the IESEG School of Management in Paris. At this point in my academic career I am looking for a 6-month marketing internship beginning in January. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I am specifically interested in the digital marketing. Amazon has always attracted me by its position as world leader as well as its international presence and innovative marketing. Thanks to my first internship at NUXE, where I discovered the importance of marketing, I became aware of my desire to work in this department. Additionally, having lived in London last year, I would like to be able to continue to work in a multicultural and international environment.
		<br>
		<br>
		Having worked for the previous 2 summers, I have learned a great deal about endurance, independence, and initiative. With that being said, I believe I would be able to adapt quickly and effectively to your standards and expectations. To speak to my commitment, last summer, I worked for 2 months at Emma&Chlo√© where I was quickly in charge of the training of the new vendors thanks to my motivation. Additionally, I would describe myself as creative, driven, and organized. I have invested myself in a photography association at my school and I have often realized team projects. 
		<br>
		<br>	
		In addition to these practical experiences, IESEG School of Management and London Metropolitan University have enabled me to benefit from numerous marketing courses such as management of marketing, mobile marketing and nudge marketing. With a combination of educational know-how and knowledge from the field, I believe that I am ready to put my skillset into practice at a more advanced level. Working for your team and learning by your side would be an incredible opportunity for me. It would also be a springboard with which I can use to launch myself into the professional realm of business that I strive to enter. As a dynamic and dedicated individual, I would be delighted to be able to join your team.
		<br>
		<br>
		Please find enclosed my resume for your consideration. While waiting for your answer, I am at your disposal for any further information. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Yours faithfully,

		Astrid LEROUX
